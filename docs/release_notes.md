# Release notes




## Notes on Master branch
If you are planning on deploying this program for use on your domain we
recommend pulling from one of the branched releases as opposed to the master
branch. While we try to keep the master branch working we consider it
"unstable" and don't recommend using it unless you want to develop for the
project.
